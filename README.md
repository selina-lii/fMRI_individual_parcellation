# fMRI - Single Parcellation

Code for Non-negative Matrix Factorization and MS-HBM, developed for the manuscript "A Connectional Gradient of Individual Variability across Functional Network Edges"


### What makes your brain unique?

 fMRI captures high-resolution 3D images of the entire human brain.

The brain is very active even when you're resting; it ripples like a summer river.

In these ripples, we can untangle brain **networks** that reflect the intrinsic architecture of the brain.

Our team studied how these networks cross-talk.



<br>

With **unsupervised learning**, we got rid of traditional templates

that align everyone’s brain to a rigid anatomical map.

This way, I generated networks that maximize what’s unique about each person’s data.


<br>


Brain networks are always talking to each other.

I looked at how the cross-talk between brain networks are different.

(By building an edge-level network; a network of network edges.)


<br>


It turns out that the part of human brain related to abstract thinking

exhibit more diverse structures.

A pattern we termed “connectional gradient”, 

which replicated across over ten types of biological data.



<br>



This project helps us further understand what is a healthy brain,

and how we can tailor treatment for disorders.

The model we harnessed is simple but explainable, a solid foundation

for applying more complex models, like neural networks.


<br>


Eventually, we’ll see digital brain and biological brain converge,

in a way that benefits us clinically and in our daily lives.
